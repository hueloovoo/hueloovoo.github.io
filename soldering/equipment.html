  <th><span class="category">Soldering Iron</span></th>
  <td>This is the main tool for soldering.  There is a huge variety of soldering irons and stations, some with multiple purposes. There are irons that come in small portable kits, irons heated by butane torch, even irons that run on power from a USB port!  I chose a generic soldering/reworking station, the Zeny 898D+, and have found it's a very serviceable soldering/hot air station, compatible with parts and tips from the more expensive name brand tools.</td>

 <tr>
  <th><span class="category">Solder and Flux</span></th>
  <td>The classic standard for electronics is 63/37 tin-lead alloy flux-core solder, which can come in a variety of thicknesses for different projects.  These days most solder is lead-free, but I haven't had much luck getting good joints with that stuff.  You may also want some quality solder braid for removing solder and cleaning up mistakes.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><span class="category">Small Hand Tools</span></th>
  <td>I keep a pair of flush cutters (wire cutters made to nip off the excess wire from parts that are soldered in place), an electrostatically protected tweezer for manipulating tiny parts, a wire stripper to remove the insulation from wires, some extra flux and a brass tip cleaning "sponge."  There are a number of other tools you may find very useful in soldering electronics for example a "helping hands" to hold components where you want them while you work.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><span class="category">Working Surface</span></th>
  <td>You will need a sturdy surface on which to work, one that you don't mind possibly scarring up with hot iron tips or dropping molten metal onto.  There are several work mats designed to protect your work area available, but I have not yet found a need for one.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th><span class="category">Patience!</span></th>
  <td>Soldering is a surprisingly tricky skill, it's easy enough to get started but only practice can turn a beginner into an expert!  I am only starting out myself, and I still struggle with tinning the tip of my soldering iron sometimes, much less convincing the solder to melt and flow correctly.  But I'm having fun learning, and making neat little devices!</td>
