<span class="category"><dt>What is soldering, and why is it important?</dt></span>
<dd>Soldering is the joining of two metal objects using molten metal (solder) as a sort of glue.  It establishes a fairly strong connection that conducts both heat and electricity well.  These bonds are critical in many applications, from jewelry to plumbing to electronics.  This site will focus on soldering for electronics.</dd>
<span class="category"><dt>What is this solder stuff?</dt></span>
<dd>Solder is a metal alloy used to bond metals.  Classically, 63%/37% tin-lead flux-core solder has been used for electronics, though recently lead-free solder is becoming more common.  There are many other kinds of solder, for a variety of uses.</dd>
<span class="category"><dt>What does "flux-core" mean?</dt></span>
<dd>Soldering involves heating metals to high temperatures, and at high temperatures metals tend to oxidize quickly.  Oxidized metal does not bond well (or at all usually) to solder.  So a flux is required to prevent or remove oxidation.  In electronics to flux is usually a solid rosin (think tree sap) that is run through the center of the solder wire.  As solder is applied, this protects the metals from oxygen, and most of it boils away in the process, causing a slight burnt-wood smell.</dd>
